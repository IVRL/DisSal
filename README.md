![Figure Abstract](fig-abstract.png)
Overview of the proposed architecture. We use an object detector to extract object instances.
We then pass on these object features to calculate appearance dissimilarity (shown in orange), which results in a
dissimilarity score for each object instance. The object detection network also outputs a bounding box for each
object, which we use to calculate the normalized object size dissimilarity (shown in green) for each detection. We
then fuse (1) the encoded global saliency features resulting from the saliency encoder, (2) the object appearance
dissimilarity features, and (3) the normalized object size dissimilarity features. We train our saliency decoder on
this concatenated feature set. We supervise the training with a KLD loss between the predicted
saliency map and the ground-truth one
